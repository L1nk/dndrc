    ~ A fiend possessed me as a child. I was locked away to protect my people from my demonic possession, but escaped when my village was razed by unknown assailants. The fiend is still inside me, but now I try to keep it locked away. Will I succeed in containing the spirit of Draugluin the first werewolf?

    ~ There's evil in me, I can feel it. It must never be set free and I must always be in control.

-- Chaotic Neutral --
Being possessed by Draugluin drives my chaotic nature, and my forced captivity has forced me to become pragmatic; always acting beyond the constructs of good and evil.

-- Wielder of Gurthang -- 
Gurthang, the iron of death, is a cursed blade forged from a fallen star. Its bloodthirst must be quenched whenever it is drawn.
 
It started when, as an orphan child and early in my training, I stumbled upon Gurthang displayed on a dais in the hall of arms. My curiosity got the better of me and I took the blade and unsheathed it.
A maniacal laughter erupted from the depths of my mind. The sword melted and reconstituted into a dark mist with red eyes. My vision clouded as the dark mist melded with me. Last thing I remember, my body felt engulfed in flames. 
I awoke locked with the blade in an underground cell with a high window. I occasionally could spy the full moon and these nights were filled with dreams of screams and blood.

In these dreams I was introduced to Draugluin, the first wolf and servant of Selune the pale horned goddess of the moon. His spirit lay trapped in the blade and after unsheathing it his soul bonded with me.
